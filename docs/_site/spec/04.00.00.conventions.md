## Conventions

  * When bit reading is finished it will always pad the read to the current
    byte.

  * Draco encoded mesh files are comprised of three main sections. This first
    section is the header. The second section contains the connectivity data.
    The third section contains the attribute data. The header must be decoded
    first, then the connectivity section, and then the attribute section.

  * The Connectivity section is composed of the following sections in order:

    * Connectivity header

    * EdgeBreaker symbol buffer

    * Start face buffer

    * EdgeBreaker valence header

    * Context data for the valence prediction

    * Hole and Split data

  * The hole and split data must be decoded before the EdgeBreaker symbols are
    decoded.
